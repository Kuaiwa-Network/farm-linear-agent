# farm-linear-agent

One Linear agent for the 农场 team. Delegate an issue to it for work, @mention it to
talk. Capabilities are added as skills on a shared identity, ledger, worker runtime and
desktop-resource locks: chat, QA, bug fix, FGUI, then whole features.

Start with the [design spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-17-farm-linear-agent-design.md).
It records the decisions, the architecture, the porting map from the two prototypes it
replaces (`FarmTestAgent` and `BugAgent`), and the phased plan.

## Run

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v          # all offline tests
python3 -m agent.service configure                 # once per host; writes .local/agent/config.json
python3 -m agent.service serve                     # receiver on 127.0.0.1:8765 plus scheduler
python3 -m agent --db .local/agent/ledger.sqlite3 status
```
